Build an ASMR app that provides an experience equivalent to an immersive visit to the pyramids in Egypt.

The app should include:
1. All the necessary visual and audio ambience to make the user feel as if they have truly visited the pyramids.
2. The best technologies and frameworks required for this level of immersion.

The overall design should feel as if Jony Ive has designed it.
